# odin-recipe
This project is done as a part of The Odin Project.
As a part of the foundations course, this project consists of the basics of html so far. 
The elements that are  covered include- lists (ordered and unordered), linking (absolute and relative) etc., among the others. Will keep updating the project as it moves. Thanks!
